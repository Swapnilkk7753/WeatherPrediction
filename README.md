# WeatherPrediction
In the weather prediction project the main goal is to predict Temprature on the basis of Pressure ,Humidity , and WindSpeed.
And In this project I use RandomForestRegressor that is collection of multiple decision tree that predict on the basis of decisions on the given dataset.
The size of dataset is approx 960000 rows with 12 columns.
And the accuracy of the this model or project is approx 86 percentage.
